    <h1>History of Video Games</h1>
   </head>
   <body>
   <p>Video games are digital games that can be played on a computer device (e.g., tablets, smartphones, laptops, consoles, etc.).Originally designed simply for entertainment, video games have grown into their own industry and field of learning, generating billions of dollars each year.</p>
<p>"All your base are belong to us"</p>
     <h2>The beginnings (1950s)</h2>
     <p>In October 1958, Physicist William Higinbotham created an early version of pong on his supercomputer. This was considered to be the first ever “video game”</p>
             <p>The first video game created for entertainment with physics was Tennis for Two</p>
     <p>The first computerized video game was Bertie the Brain</p>
<h2>Home gaming begins (1960-1983)</h2>
<p>In 1972 Magnavox sold the magnavox odyssey which was the first ever actual home gaming console that could be connected to a TV using av cables. All it did was play pong but you could put different filter looking plastic covers you would put onto your tv to give pong different backgrounds</p>
<p>In 1977 atari came out with one of the most iconic video game systems of all time; Atari 2600, which introduced more than just pong to your TV. With a wood grain finish and a new controller consisting of a singular red button and a stiff joystick.</p> 
            <p>The real breakthrough for the home video game market occurred in 1980 when Atari released a conversion of the popular Space Invaders game for the VCS, by the success of the game, Atari's consumer sales doubled from $119 million to nearly $204 million in 1980 and then exploded to over $841 million in 1981</p>
            <h2>North American Video Game Crash (1983)</h2>
    <p>In 1983 The great North American video game crash happened due to multiple factors; One being oversaturation, because everyone wanted to jump onto the video game money train. Before 1983, there were around 18 different systems on the market.</p>
<p>Another factor to the crash was with the misleading covers, more of a quantity over quality type of situation. But on with the misleading covers, the box art on games would look amazing and would show the game to be out of this world. But when someone popped in the cartridge, a horrible looking game would await them.</p>

<p>The biggest contributor to the crash was the people’s thought that video games were neash and a passing fad that would burn out soon, so people stopped buying consoles and games, which was a real punch in the gut for console video games.</p>
    <h2>The Rise of Games in the East</h2>
    <p>Halfway across the world in Japan, a company known for making toys and cards, Nintendo, dipped their toes in the waters of gaming and came out with the Famicom in 1983. (short for Family Computer) In Japan, it was a huge hit and the company thought of taking to the American video game market with their system. But before they did that they had to consider what they were planning on doing. Spending money to send their systems to a market that was currently in shambles? Nintendo had to be smart with their movements if they wanted to succeed.</p>
    <p>After trial and error, time and money; Nintendo brought the system to  America. But not as a video game system or the Famicom. It was an entertainment system (Nintendo entertainment system specifically) to draw attention away from the word “video game.” It was made to look a, with a front-loading cartridge reader. But the features that sold it the most was R.O.B., the robot operating buddy that would play games like Gyromite with you. And the zapper you would play Duck Hunt with. The NES was put on store shelves in 1985 with a response of critical acclaim. None of their future consoles would sell better in America until the Wii in 2008. Nintendo, for the most part, saved the North American video game market. </p>
    <p>With the success of the NES in America, other actual, non-cash grabbing video game companies wanted to join in, like Sega who already had a foothold in gaming in Japan with their SG-1000. They released their first North American system in 1985 called the Sega Master System. Which had two slots, one for cartridges and another for storage. Just little cards.</p>
    <p>The year is 1993, video games are booming in North America again, Nintendo has created the successor to the NES, the Super Nintendo entertainment system, Sega has also evolved the master system into the Sega Genesis, and Atari is in the handheld games market. And then there is a game-An arcade game more specifically-ported to home consoles, its name is Mortal Kombat. Now Mortal Kombat isn't just a regular fighting game, it was a brutally gory game that had that feature removed on home consoles to keep kids safe. But on the Sega Genesis, it was an unlockable feature. This made parents angry, although they didn’t do much besides complain. But there was another game by the title of Night Trap. It was a movie that you would make certain decisions to affect the outcome. If you picked the wrong decision, the game over screens would look gruesome, including one of a woman getting her blood pumped out by a collar held by men in black. This caught the attention of the U.S. government and Nintendo and Sega were called to a congressional hearing about the violence in video games and how children could easily buy a game intended for an older audience and think it was a fun little Mario game. Because of this, the Entertainment Software Rating Board (ESRB) was created to rate video games from EC (Early Child) to AO (Adult Only) and ensure safety for children playing video games.</p>

    <h2>Tech Company Takeover (1995-2010)</h2>
    <p> Going ahead one year and Nintendo is in development for a cd addition to the Super Nintendo entertainment system in partnership with Sony, a fellow Japanese company that manufactured electronics. The add-on was to be called the Nintendo PlayStation. But fearing Sony would use the CD add-on to kickstart their way into the video games market, Nintendo pulled out of the deal the day the add-on was announced and partnered with Philips, another electronics company based in the Netherlands. This angered Sony, rightfully so. And in their spite, Sony used what they knew from working with Nintendo to create the biggest competitor to Nintendo's consoles, the PlayStation. </p>
    <p>In 1998 Sega released the Dreamcast in Japan and later in 1999 in North America, the first 128-bit console on the market, very successful. But the looming threat of the Playstation 2 was iminate. Soon after the release of the Playstation 2, and poor sales, Sega announced they would be pulling out of the hardware business and become just a software developer.</p>
    <p> Sometime during the unveiling of the playstation 2, Microsoft was becoming concerned with how sony was moving its way into living rooms. </p>
